# Prototype for a new BTCPayServer UI

> Developers on brink of second UI for BTCPay

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

Dependencies are managed via npm.
Once you have cloned this repo, you can setup the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a build and rebuild on file change:

```bash
npm start
```

This will bring up the dev server and pattern library on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
You can also skip the pattern library and go [straight to the Homepage](http://localhost:3000/_variants/_default/Home/Home.html-1.html).
